            <h2>Underweight Health Risks</h2>
            <p>If you are underweight, you may be at risk of several health issues, including osteoporosis and muscle weakness. Proper exercise, diet, and lifestyle changes are important to address these risks.</p>

            <h3>Starting an Exercise Routine</h3>
            <p>The workout program you begin depends on how underweight you are, the reasons for your low weight, and your overall fitness abilities. If you are severely underweight due to illness, it is important to consult with a doctor about the best exercises to regain strength. Your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist or a personal trainer depending on your condition.</p>

            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>Your caloric needs may be significantly higher than the average. Men typically need around 2500 calories, and women need around 2000 calories per day. However, if you are underweight, your caloric intake should be higher in order to gain weight. A nutrition professional can help you determine your daily caloric needs to achieve a healthy weight.</p>

            <h4>Healthy Weight Gain</h4>
            <p>Gaining weight healthfully is often harder than losing weight. It is essential to do it gradually, focusing on healthy weight gain rather than quick fat accumulation. High-fat foods or protein powders can contribute to health issues if used excessively. Build your weight slowly and focus on healthy foods.</p>

            <h3>Osteoporosis</h3>
            <p>Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become weak and brittle. It is more common in individuals who are underweight. Osteoporosis can lead to fractures even with mild stresses like bending over or coughing. It occurs when the formation of new bone cannot keep up with the loss of old bone. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, along with strength training, can help prevent osteoporosis.</p>

            <h4>Recommendation:</h4>
            <div class="recommendations">
                <ul>
                    <li>Consult a doctor and a nutritionist to ensure you're eating enough calories to support healthy weight gain.</li>
                    <li>Focus on strength training exercises to build muscle and support bone health.</li>
                    <li>Engage in activities such as weightlifting, yoga, or Pilates to strengthen bones and muscles.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Food Recommendation:</h4>
            <p>Focus on nutrient-dense, calorie-rich foods like nuts, avocados, whole grains, lean meats, and dairy. Foods rich in calcium and vitamin D, such as dairy products and leafy greens, can support bone health.</p>

            <h4>Exercise Recommendation:</h4>
            <p>Strength training exercises like weightlifting or bodyweight exercises (e.g., squats, lunges) can help build muscle and prevent bone loss. Aerobic exercises, such as walking or swimming, can improve cardiovascular health.</p>
